#### The nature of application development has changed. 
Whether you’re building enterprise applications to manage your most
sensitive business data or mobile apps to engage
digital-native consumers, it’s not about what your team can build from
scratch — it’s about how effectively they can connect
to and build upon what already exists, both within your company and beyond it.

That’s why we want to create a development platform that prioritize interoperability, and openness.
