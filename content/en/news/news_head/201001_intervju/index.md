#### Why is this network needed?

*”Our contacts with other authorities show that there are many queries and challenges regarding to open data. These may have to do with anything from licences and legislation to solution of practical problems.  At the same time, the Government is increasingly pushing for Sweden to invest in open data and reuse of state resources. And so, we called around to find out what others are doing to reach out to users, what challenges they face, and how they measure investments and ensure benefits. When we realized that many people face exactly the same challenges,
the idea was born to create a network, where we help and inspire each other to move our work forward.”*

#### Who has joined in? 

*”We, at JobTech Development and the Public Employment Service have created a planning group together with Samtrafiken, Digg, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, the Internet Foundation, and the National Patent and Registration Office. Our workshops which, have been organised by us, have been attended by participants from over one hundred organisations, of which the majority were various authorities and other public actors. 
A huge amount of interest has been shown, with workshops filled to the brim on both occasions, which makes us very happy!”*

#### What exactly happens at the network meetings?

*”The greater part of our first workshop was devoted to the discussion of licensing conditions which should apply to the authorities’ open data in Sweden. An official policy which the Patent and Registration Office is supposed to draw up is on its way, and we were all invited to participate in the discussion. Other than that, we discuss how to interact with each other, share our knowledge and inspire each other, for example, by providing practical examples. 
We are also in the process of creating an open data portal for sharing data, where anyone who wants to can share their data with others in a concrete way.”*

#### What is the most important contribution of JobTech Development/the Public Employment Service here?

*”We co-ordinate, harmonise and promote developmental changes, since we know that there is an unfulfilled need of collaboration. It is important that we start working in concrete terms with the here and now, and that we do not just sit and wait for a new law or something of that kind. We also contribute by showing other authorities what we are doing in the area of open data and open-source software – both as regards our successes and challenges facing us.”*


#### What do you hope that the network meetings will lead to?
*” I hope that each respective authority will start sharing their resources and experiences to a larger degree than until now. 
Many are used to sharing data if someone requires it, but we need to be more proactive.  Unfortunately, international surveys show that Sweden is lagging behind with regard do innovation based on open data, so there is certainly a big job to be done waiting for us. We have to make sure to get better survey results, and, ultimately, it has to do with creating a better life for those who live in Sweden”*
