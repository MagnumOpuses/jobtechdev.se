**A collaboration project initiated by JobTech Development and involving Sweden’s major advertisement and job-matching actors, is going to make it possible to create a fully comprehensive presentation of all the job advertisements on the market – and job-seekers won’t need to worry about missing out on job opportunities. The technical system is currently being tested as a pilot in Platsbanken.**

The collaboration project ”Ecosystem for advertisements” means that advertisements and job-matching actors will open up and share their job advertisement data in one joint digital ecosystem. The goal is partly to make it easier for job-seekers to navigate among job advertisements and find jobs, no matter what platform they are on, and partly to produce more documentation for Statistics Sweden’s labour market statistics.

*”We need to address the issue of digital restructuring which has led to, among other things, people currently having to navigate among many different advertisement platforms when looking for jobs, while not being sure whether they have access to all the available jobs. Neither Arbetsförmedlingen nor any other player can solve this problem by themselves, since no one has access to all job advertisements and that is why we are doing this together,”* says **Maria Dalhage**, project manager at  **JobTech Development / Arbetsförmedlingen** which is providing the technical systems that are needed for the joint sharing and handling of advertisement data.  

The actors who have entered the collaboration and thereby chosen to share their advertisement data are Blocket, CareerBuilder, Jobbdirekt, Monster, NetJobs, Offentliga Jobb, OnePartnerGroup and Studentjob. Together with the advertisements that are already presented in Platsbanken, this amounts to about 80 percent of the job advertisements on the market.  

*””The pandemic has meant that we have more people looking for work at the same time as there are fewer job advertisements. Right now, it is more important than ever before to facilitate job-seeking, and as one of the largest commercial players in this field, it felt completely natural for us to be part of the collaboration”*, says **Matilda Adelborg**, press officer at Blocket Jobb.

*”At Monster, we are looking forward to this collaboration which is going to make it much easier for job-seekers to find a new and exciting job. This is completely in line with Monster’s goal which is to match up job-seekers and employers in the best possible way*, says **Per Wadell**, country manager på Monster.

The technical system – API ”JobTech Links” – will be tested initially as a pilot in Platsbanken.

*”With the pilot, we will study how the API works in practice and evaluate how the users perceive the interface. We will also follow up our partners’ experiences of the collaboration and ensure we have a sustainable model that is of benefit to all parties. We hope that more players will join us since our ultimate goal is to have one hundred percent of the advertisements”*, says **Maria Dalhage**.  

In the long term, the system may become an open API which anyone can use to gain access to all advertisement links.  
*”Our aim is to create an open API but our main focus at the moment is to bring about successful cooperation and a sustainable model which we will be able to scale up”*, concludes **Maria Dalhage**.
