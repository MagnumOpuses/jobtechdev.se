### Why is it interesting to follow JobTech Development?

*”It is very exciting to follow how you work with open data and open source software, and above all how you collaborate with actors within one and the same ecosystem around both the data and the software. With the research hat on, I can say that it is unique and forward-looking, and so far there is little reported and written in the field. The general debate in the public sector is focused on opening up and publishing your data, but there is a limited focus on collaboration and the connection to open source software. That is why JobTech Development and the ecosystem you are building is a cutting-edge project that many can learn from”*

### What do you do in your role as a companion researcher?

*”As a companion researcher, I have two roles. First is to help JobTech Development to build a sustainable ecosystem. I support, coach and provide input from research on how to collaborate on open data and open source software. Second, I follow how the ecosystem develops and compare with other examples in the outside world and give feedback to JobTech. I have, for example, compared with Trafiklab, which is Samtrafiken's platform for open data connected to public transport in Sweden. I have also taken a closer look at open data ecosystems in Finland and the US. In addition, I work to spread knowledge about how authorities can use and collaborate on open data and open source software. One outcome is the newly formed Network for Open Source and Data (NOSAD.se) where we arrange workshops and gather materials that can help authorities in their work with these issues.”*

### You have been following JobTech Development for about a year, and have come halfway into your work. What have you come up with so far?

*”One insight is that authorities can collaborate on the data they open up in many different ways. JobTech Development is one example, Trafiklab another. What works best depends on the case. It has also been fun to see the strong synergy effect that exists between open source software and open data. Partly as a way to inspire how the data can be used and support developers implementing their solutions, partly to create transparency about how the data is used, and partly to enable the provision of the data. If a municipality is on a closed system, it can be so bad that they do not even have access to the data. ”*

### What should your work as a companion researcher lead to?

*”I hope that it contributes to a stronger ecosystem, that more actors are added and that the data comes into use, and that this in turn leads to better matching between employers and jobseekers. I also hope that the work and research can help authorities, both in Sweden and internationally, to improve their work with open data and open source software. ”*


### How can those who are interested take part in your work?
*”A tip is to go to [NOSAD](https://Nosad.se.) There you can take part in research articles, open source policies, reports and training materials. I also share material via my Twitter and LinkedIn accounts (@johanlinaker).  
In our[forum](https://forum.jobtechdev.se/c/natverket-oppna-data-oppen-kallkod) You can follow what happens in NOSAD and join discussions within the JobTech area.”*
