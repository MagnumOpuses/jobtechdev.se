The API is especially useful for companies and organisations that have their own search engine and wish to improve their service with advertisement data updated in real time. It is also useful for those who wish to be able to identify and analyse trends in the labour market with the aid of advertisement data. Developers who need access to large quantities of advertisement data for algorithm training will also benefit from the API.

**The API is freely available.**
