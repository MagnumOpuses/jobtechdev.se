The purpose of JobTech Taxonomy is to provide a relevant vocabulary for important elements in the language for the labour market.

JobTech Taxonomy contains concepts that describe, among other things, occupations, skills and relationships between them, 
which can be used for example as a basis for matching. The content is continuously updated in consultation with actors in the labour market.

#### Paradigm of the Future
Our aim is for the labour market terminology observed via text analysis and data collection to help enrich the content of JobTech Taxonomy - but not without quality assurance. 
We believe that optimal results are achieved when a data driven approach meets an expert driven.

* [Occupations and skills in Sweden](/pdfjs/web/viewer.html?file=/pdf/occupations_skills_Sweden.pdf)
* [Taxonomy API]({{< ref "/api/terms/taxonomy/_index.md" >}})
* [Ontology API]({{< ref "/api/terms/ontology/_index.md" >}})

#### RoadMap


* Migrate the JobTech Taxonomy into a new database and create new identifiers for all values in the Taxonomy
* Release a new API for the JobTech Taxonomy 
* Release a new synchronizing mechanism to allow consumers to stay updated with the JobTech Taxonomy
* Merge the JobTech Ontology with the JobTech Taxonomy and create new identifiers for all values in the Ontology
