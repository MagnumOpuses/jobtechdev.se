#### Paradigm of the Future

##### Usage
The information about all jobs are used in [JobTech Search]({{< ref "projects/search/_index.md" >}}).
To show how this information can be used the application [Jobscanner]({{< ref "samples/_index.md/#scanner" >}}) was created.
The continues improvement of the [JobTech Taxonomy]({{< ref "projects/common/_index.md" >}}) is done with help of JobTech Jobs.

##### Current APIs
* [Open Jobs]({{< ref "api/jobs/platsbanken/_index.md" >}}) from Swedish Public Employment Service
* [Historical Job ads]({{< ref "api/jobs/historical/_index.md" >}})

##### Coming API
* Open Jobs aggregated from all job posting sites
