### Everything in life is give and take - even JobTech

 We believe that open source is the way to go regarding digital innovation in the Swedish labour market. We’re happy to provide you with whatever we can to make your ideas a reality, but we also expect you to give back in some form. 
 There are many ways to share your ideas and expertise in our ecosystem in order to give back.
 
 Share code, share knowledge, share data, every contribution counts! Let’s talk and find something that fits and feels good.
