Our job search API is a search engine for all the current job adds from Platsbanken. 
The aim is to make a simple yet versatile API that should suit anyone building any kind of application involving data from job adds. 
There is a lot going on under the hood with how we index the adds for relevance but weâ€™re trying to keep the complexity away from the API users.

More information will come as soon as the APi is released.
