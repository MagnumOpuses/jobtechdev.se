#### JobTech provides APIs from different sources:

• **Labour market relevant APIs** - Data and functionality created in collaboration between public and private sector for the labour market.   
• **Swedish Public Employment Service** - APIs from the Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen)

To access certain APIs you need to request a key, the process will differ depending on the source.
Information on how to register for a key will be provided at the API page.

The information you provide will be used for statistical purposes and for reaching out to you in case of scheduled downtime, bug reporting etc.
In a second phase, we will use this information to create an account where you will be able to manage your keys directly.

By requesting the API Key, you are authorizing the data you are providing, to be stored for as long as you will have access to this API.
