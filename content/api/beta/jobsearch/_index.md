Our job search API is a search engine for all the current job ads from Platsbanken. 
The aim is to make a simple yet versatile API that should suit anyone building any kind of application involving data from job ads. 
There is a lot going on under the hood with how we index the ads for relevance but we’re trying to keep the complexity away from the API users.

If you would like to test the api, send an email to <beta@jobtechdev.se>
This is an early access but it is most certainly the way the API will look when published. The addresses will be changed. Keep an eye at jobtechdev.se and 
get registered in the jobtechdevelopment.slack.com to get the latest information.

There might be a maximum number of users allowed.
