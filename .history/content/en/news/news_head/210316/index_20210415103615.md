**During the spring, JobTech Development will arrange open webinars for anyone who wants help getting started with our APIs. The next opportunity is Friday, April 23.**


To make it even easier to use our APIs, we will organize four webinars in the spring where we provide a technical introduction and the opportunity to ask questions directly to our developers. The webinars are primarily aimed at new and existing users, but are open to anyone who wants to know more about how our APIs can be used for the development of digital services for the labor market.

At the webinars, our development team, represented by **Johan Brymér Dahlhielm** and **Henrik Suzuki**, will provide information and practical guidance for APIs such as "JobSearch", "JobStream" and "JobTech Taxonomy". This is followed by an open conversation with the opportunity to ask questions, give feedback and present ideas and wishes for new technical solutions from JobTech Development.

*“We look forward to helping and inspiring new users through this spring's webinars. Through more dialogue and feedback, we also get a greater opportunity to improve our products and become more accurate when we develop new technical solutions for the labor market"*, says **Henrik Suzuki**.

All webinars will be held according to the "open space" model, which means that the agenda and topics of conversation are largely governed by the participants' specific interests and needs.
